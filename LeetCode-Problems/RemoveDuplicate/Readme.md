# Explaination

1. Function Declaration:

`var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {...}`: This line defines a function named removeDuplicates that takes an array of numbers (nums) as input and returns a number.
i Initialization:

let i = 0;: This line declares a variable i and initializes it to 0. This variable will be used as an index to keep track of the position where the next unique element should be placed in the array.
Looping Through the Array:

for (let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {...}: This line starts a for loop that iterates through the nums array. The loop variable j starts at 1 (skipping the first element) and continues until j is less than the length of the array (nums.length).
Checking for Duplicates:

if (nums[j] !== nums[i]) {...}: Inside the loop, this line checks if the current element at index j (accessed using nums[j]) is different from the element at the current i index (accessed using nums[i]).
Shifting Elements (if Not Duplicates):

If the elements at j and i are not the same (meaning a unique element is found):
i++;: This line increments the i index by 1. This creates a space in the array to store the unique element.
nums[i] = nums[j];: This line copies the unique element from nums[j] to the new position at nums[i]. Essentially, it shifts the unique elements towards the beginning of the array.
Returning the Number of Unique Elements:

After the loop completes, the i index points to the last position where a unique element was placed.
return i + 1;: This line returns i + 1, which represents the number of unique elements found in the array.

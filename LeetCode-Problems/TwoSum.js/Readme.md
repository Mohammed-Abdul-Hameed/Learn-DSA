# Explaination

The function twoSum takes in an array of numbers (nums) and a target sum (target).
It uses a nested loop to iterate over each pair of numbers in the array.
For each pair, it checks if the sum of the two numbers equals the target.
If a pair with the desired sum is found, it returns the indices of the two numbers in an array.
If no such pair is found, it returns an empty array.
Technique used:

This code uses a brute-force approach to find the pair of numbers that sum up to the target. It exhaustively checks all possible pairs of numbers until it finds the desired sum.
Better Use Case:

While this solution works fine for small arrays, it has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means it may become inefficient for large arrays. A better approach for larger arrays would be to use a hashmap (or JavaScript object) to store the complements of each number as we iterate through the array. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n) by sacrificing a bit of space complexity. Here's a brief outline of how it would work:
Iterate through the array, and for each number, calculate its complement (target - current number).
Check if the complement exists in the hashmap. If it does, return the indices of the current number and its complement.
If the complement does not exist in the hashmap, store the current number along with its index in the hashmap.
If no solution is found after iterating through the entire array, return an empty array.

# Array

An array is a linear Data Structure that stores the data of similar types.
It is a static data structure with fixed size.

## Types of Array operations -

- **Traversal**: Traverse through the elements of an array.
- **Insertion**: Inserting a new element in an array.
- **Deletion**: Deleting element from the array.
- **Searching**: Search for an element in the array.
- **Sorting**: Maintaining the order of elements in the array.

## Advantages of Arrays

1. Accessing elements is faster.
2. Better Cache.
3. Data of the same type is stored.

## Disadvantages of Array

1. Fixed memory size; memory can't be increased once allocated.
2. It cannot store values of different data types.
3. Deletion and Insertion are very difficult to implement.

## Applications of Arrays

1. Database records are usually implemented as Arrays.
2. Used in sorting algorithms.
3. Many more.

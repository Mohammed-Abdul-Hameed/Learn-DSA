# Linear Search

- Linear Search is an algorithm that starts at one end and goes till the another end until the desired element is found

## Algorithm

1. Start
2. Set i = 0
3. Repeat while i < n (length of the array)
4. If arr[i] = x
5. Return i
6. i++; else
7. Return -1
8. Stop

## Complexity of the algorithm

1. Time Complexity: O(n)
2. Space Complexity: O(1)

Advantages: 1. Sorting can be done irrespective the size of the array or whether it is sorted or not. 2. Does not require extra memory

## When to use Linear Search?

1. When we are dealing with a small dataset.
2. When you are searching for a dataset stored in contiguous memory.

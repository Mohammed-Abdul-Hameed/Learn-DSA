# Binary Search

1. This algorithm is used to find the target value in the array by dividing them into half.
   
2. Binary Search must be only implemented if the data is sorted. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval becomes empty.
   
3. It relies on the fact that the array is sorted, allowing it to efficiently narrow down the search space.

Binary search is fantastic for larger datasets!
